## Question1: The cost of a string

Your task is to create a string S considering lowercase English alphabets. You are given an array A of size 26 where A[i] denotes the cost of using the ith Alphabet (consider 1-based indexing). Find lexicographically the largest string S that can be created such that the cost of building the string is exactly W. For example, ‘abc’ is lexicographically smaller than ‘abcd’.

##### Input format:

The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains 26 space-separated integers denoting the costs of characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’.
The second line of each test case contains an integer W.

##### Output format: 

For each test case, print the required string S in a new line.
